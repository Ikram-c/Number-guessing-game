    "\n",
    "- Tell the user the number range they will be guessing within\n",
    "- Ask the user for an input\n",
    "- Print what they answered and state if it is correct or incorrect\n",
    "- Then print whether or not it is higher or lower\n",
    "- If it is incorrect, allow user to guess a total of 3 times\n",
    "- If they are out of guesses or have guessed the correct number Print out their guesses and the correct number\n",
    "- Ask the user if they want to play again\n",
    "- If they decide to stop playing, output the number of attempts and correct guesses"
