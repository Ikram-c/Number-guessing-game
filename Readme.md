A simple command-line number guessing game built with Python. The program generates a random number, and the user must guess it within three attempts.

4.  After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess was **too high** or **too low**.
5.  If you guess correctly, you win the round!
6.  If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the secret number.
