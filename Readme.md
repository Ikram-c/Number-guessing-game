# Number Guessing Game

The aim of the project was to create a Number guessing game in which you generate a random number and compare it to a user's input. This project used globals and randint

Requirements:
- Tell the user the number range they will be guessing within
- Ask the user for an input
- Print what they answered and state if it is correct or incorrect
- Then print whether or not it is higher or lower
- If it is incorrect, allow user to guess a total of 3 times
- If they are out of guesses or have guessed the correct number Print out their guesses and the correct number
- Ask the user if they want to play again
- If they decide to stop playing, output the number of attempts and correct guesses
